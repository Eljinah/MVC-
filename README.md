# NYC Crash Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **New York City (NYC) motor vehicle crash data** to identify key trends, hotspots, and time-based crash patterns.  
It demonstrates a complete **data engineering and analytics pipeline** using **Snowflake**, **Python**, and **SQL** for handling, transforming, and analyzing large-scale data (2M+ records).

Through this project, I showcased my ability to:
- Design and manage **data pipelines** and **data warehouses**
- Perform **complex SQL aggregations** and trend analysis
- Create **data-driven insights** and communicate findings through visualization

## Technologies Used
1. Programming Language : Python (Pandas)
2. Data Warehouse : Snowflake
3. Querying : SQL (aggregation, window functions)
4. Data Loading : SnowSQL CLI
5. Visualization : Excel, PowerPoint 


## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- Extracted **2M+ crash records** from the [NYC Open Data Portal]
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using **Python & Pandas**.
- Loaded the data into **Snowflake** using the **SnowSQL** CLI for scalable querying.

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling & Storage
- Created **Snowflake tables** for structured storage.
- Defined staging and analytical layers to improve performance.
- Validated data quality and consistency during ingestion.

### 3️⃣ Data Transformation & Analysis
Performed multiple analytical queries in Snowflake to extract key insights:
- 🚗 **Top crash boroughs**
- 🕓 **Peak crash times (Day/Night)**
- 📍 **Top 3 crash locations**
